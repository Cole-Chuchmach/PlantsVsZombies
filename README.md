# PlantsVsZombies

This old Java project was made in Java during my last year at Sturgeon Heights, I'd used what knowledge to make this attempted recreation of the old game.

Where I wish I could go back and change was the use of largely repeated code which looking at now is very poor in quality, I had attempted to switch to a linked list style implementation, but the due date for the project had gotten very close to submittion date and I had no time to debug and implement fully.

However, I am still very proud of how everything turned out, and would love to do something like this again.
