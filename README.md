# PlantsVsZombies

This old Java project was made in Java during my last year at Sturgeon Heights, I'd used what knowledge I learned during my I.B. semester to make this attempted recreation of the old game.

What I wish I could go back and change was the use of largely repeated code which looking at now is very poor in quality, I had attempted to switch to a linked list style implementation, but the due date for the project had gotten very close to submittion date and I had no time to debug and implement fully.

However, I am still very proud of how everything turned out, and would love to do something like this again.

For information on what was included in this game, read below:

Game Implementations:
  - 5 levels, matching the first 5 in game.
  - 5 Unique plants (Pea Shooter, Sun Flower, Wall-Nut, Potato Mine, Cherry Bomb).
  - Random Zombie AI.
  - Pea Shooter Intersect Shooting.
  - Digging up Plants.
  - File Save System for continuing from a stage if the player lost or quit the game.
